## Home Automation System
**Overview**
This project is a comprehensive Home Automation System designed as part of the Digital Logic Design curriculum. It simulates the core functionalities of a smart home—including climate control, lighting automation, and security protocols—using Finite State Machines (FSM) and digital logic principles.

The system processes various sensor inputs to transition between states, ensuring efficient power consumption and enhanced home security through a robust logical architecture.

Technical Specifications
As a project rooted in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, it focuses on the following technical concepts:

State Machine Architecture: Designed using Moore/Mealy Machine models to handle complex state transitions.

Logic Optimization: Minimized Boolean expressions using Karnaugh Maps (K-Map) for efficient hardware implementation.

Synchronous Design: All transitions are synchronized with a global clock signal to prevent race conditions and glitches.

Input/Output Mapping: Integration of simulated sensors (Temperature, LDR, Motion) and actuators (Relays, LEDs, Alarms).

**Key Features**
Climate Control Unit: Automatically manages HVAC systems based on temperature threshold inputs.

Smart Lighting: Logic-based lighting control that responds to ambient light levels and room occupancy.

Integrated Security System: A state-dependent alarm system that triggers based on unauthorized entry detection and sensor feedback.

Status Monitoring: Real-time feedback of the current system state via digital outputs.

Design Methodology
The design process followed standard digital engineering workflows:

State Diagram Construction: Defining the logical flow and transition conditions.

State Table Derivation: Mapping inputs and current states to next states and outputs.

Logic Simplification: Deriving optimized equations for the combinational logic circuits.

Simulation & Verification: Testing the logic against various edge cases to ensure system stability.
